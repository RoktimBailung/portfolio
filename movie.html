                <p>The fourth installment in the Beverly Hills Cop film series comes a whole 30 years after the third film and 40 years after the original film that started it all. Eddie Murphy reprises his role as Detroit detective Axel Foley, who returns once more to Beverly Hills after he uncovers a conspiracy that puts both his estranged daughter (played by Taylour Paige) and his old friend Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold, reprising his role from the original films) in danger. That all sounds serious, but Axel F is just as freewheeling as its predecessors — its titular character gets into his usual antics, from car chases to false identities. With a mix of familiar characters like​​ John Ashton’s John Taggart and Paul Reiser’s Jeffrey Friedman, as well as new characters played by Paige, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Kevin Bacon, Axel F is an ideal sequel. It pays tribute to the old while making room for the new.</p>

                <p>Damsel gives new meaning to the term fairy-tale wedding. This fantasy-action film stars Millie Bobby Brown as Elodie, a young woman who agrees to marry a prince from a mysterious royal family at the urging of her father — he assures her that the marriage will help the people in their impoverished community. It’s only after the wedding, when Elodie participates in a strange ceremony with her new husband and his family, that she discovers she’s been roped into something bigger than she could’ve imagined. (Though, to be fair, she did ignore a warning from her stepmother, played by Angela Bassett, who urged her not to go through with the marriage.) Elodie is thrown into a cavern as a sacrifice to a dragon as part of a centuries-old arrangement, and she quickly learns she’s just the latest in a long line of brides to meet such a fate. From there, Elodie shifts into survival mode, clawing her way out by any means necessary.</p>

                <p>Chris Hemsworth goes full surrogate dad mode in this film about Tyler Rake, a mercenary who becomes involved with a mission to retrieve the kidnapped son of a drug lord. After Rake is betrayed and the mission grows more dangerous, he commits to stopping at nothing to get the boy home. Directed by Sam Hargrave (in his first feature film) and adapted by Joe Russo from Ande Parks’ graphic novel Ciudad, Extraction is the kind of rousing thriller that’ll keep you hooked all the way through. Once you finish, you can jump right to its 2023 sequel, which adds Idris Elba to the mix as a mysterious stranger who recruits Tyler for a dangerous mission to rescue the family of a notorious gangster. Both films are known for their enormous and ambitious one-shot action sequences, which must be seen to be believed</p>

                <p>Mark Duplass and director Patrick Brice put an invigorating spin on the 2010s’ found footage craze with Creep, a two-hander about a videographer (Duplass) hired to record what he’s told is a diary meant for a dying man’s (Brice) unborn child. At first, the guy seems charming. Then his eerie eccentricities start to show, and a sense of dread takes over. Maybe he’s not who he says at all. In a taut 77 minutes, Creep becomes an ominous battle of wills between two strangers in a dimly lit house. (Its sequel, starring Desiree Akhavan, is also available on Netflix.)</p>

                <p>Under the Shadow debuted at the Sundance Film Festival, after which it became one of the most celebrated horror movies of 2016. It’s a politically conscious supernatural story about a former medical student (Narges Rashidi) in war-torn Iran. When her young daughter (Avin Manshadi) insists that she senses some sort of insidious spirit in their house, things start to go bump in the night. Blending Islamic mythology and real-world terrors, Under the Shadow is guaranteed to induce chills with its nightmarish take on oppression.</p>

                <p>After establishing his horror bona fides with the Creep movies, director Patrick Brice went full-throttle on the slasher genre. The aptly titled There’s Someone Inside Your House, adapted from a 2017 novel of the same name by Stephanie Perkins, follows an exchange student (Sydney Park) who’s still adjusting to life in a new town when her classmates start getting slaughtered left and right. High school, with its pent-up emotions and impressionable teenagers, has always been the perfect backdrop for a serial-killer showdown. These particular murders contain an added bite because the assassin wears masks that resemble the faces of the victims. </p>

                <p>'Annie Hall' is as Woody Allen as Woody Allen gets – hilarious, neurotic and occupied by the realisation that whatever happens, life is going to trample all over you. It’s also one of the greatest romantic comedies every made (with some of the funniest lines: ‘Don’t knock masturbation. It’s sex with someone I love’). Allen is Alvy Singer, who’s just split from scatty singer Annie (Diane Keaton, his real-life ex). What follows is an anatomy of their relationship. Allen has said that the film is not autobiographical – he co-wrote it with Marshall Brickman – but that’s not what we want to hear.</p>

                <li><b><u>Duck Soup (1933)</u></b></li>
                <br/><img src="https://media.timeout.com/images/105187406/1536/864/image.webp" height="200"/>

                <p>What to say when a film is creeping towards its first century but still feels as timely, relevant and subversive as it did on release? The Marx Brothers’s best movie, Duck Soup takes them far out of their New York music hall milieu and into a kind of twisted miniature Mittel-Europa filtered through immigrant memory and fairytales, where war is brewing between the proud people of Freedonia and the crypto-fascists of neighbouring Sylvania. With a far lighter touch than Chaplin’s Great Dictator, the film lampoons not just fascism but patriotism and politics in general: this is satire deployed both with a sledgehammer and a scalpel, often in the same scene.</p>

                <li><b><u>The Naked Gun</u></b></li><br/>
                <img src="https://media.timeout.com/images/105187428/1536/864/image.webp" height="200"/><br/>
                <p>Where to watch :-<a href="https://www.primevideo.com/detail/The-Naked-Gun-From-the-Files-of-Police-Squad/0R50AOV6RTF8BNPMZIIRE7O3GC">www.amazonoprime.com</a></p>  
                <p>Second only to Airplane! in the gag-for-gag hit-rate stakes, The Naked Gun never met a dumb pun, slapstick pratfall or deadpan one-liner it didn’t like. The film made Leslie Nielsen a bigger star than he’d ever been playing straight-man roles in ‘proper’ disaster movies – though it has to be said, he tossed away that goodwill almost immediately in the likes of Dracula: Dead and Loving It – and spawned a fistful of sequels, of which the first is well worth watching for the amazing ‘awfully big moustache’ line alone. </p>
